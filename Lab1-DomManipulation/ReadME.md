# Lab 1: DOM manipulation with JavaScript
You are requested to create a very basic shopping cart app in a web page by using Javascript and HTML, and optionally CSS code for styling.

Your web page will ask the user for the name of a product/item and its price.

When the user is done entering the data for a product, the user will click an add button.

Once such button is clicked, you must keep record of that item and show it to the user in a list, just as we saw in the final code sample during out last session.

Each new row should have its own delete button, so that you can remove it from the HTML list.

Show at all moment the total of the sale (sum of all prices for the added items). This total should be updated according to what the user does.

Validate inputs: don't accept characters as the price of products as you won't be able to do math with them.

If you want to add messages, alerts, or further feedback, this is welcome and can give you extra points.

For this assignment, you are encouraged not to use JS libraries, please stick to vanilla JS to demonstrate your skill with it.

Elements that you will be using include: functions, listeners, adding/removing elements from DOM.

Practice, practice, practice, the more you do (even if it is out of the scope of the lab) the more you'll learn, naturally that is if time allows it.
