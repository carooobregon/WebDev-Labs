# Lab 5: Querying the Pok√©mon API with MongoDB/Mongoose - enabled cache

## Description
Create the same pokemon deck app (retrieve pokemon data using ExpressJS as an intermediate point) but now the cache mechanism is going to be powered by a database instance.

You will need to create the schema for the pokemon collection. The fields of this schema should be all the fields that you are presenting to the user.

Deliverables: both the server and client-side code.
